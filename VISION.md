## The Problem

Blockchain protocols are powerful but inaccessible. The barrier between "I want to do something on-chain" and actually doing it is enormous — you need to understand IDLs, PDAs, transaction construction, fee models, slippage, account derivation, and a dozen other concepts just to execute a simple trade.

AI agents are changing everything else — writing code, managing workflows, analyzing data — but they can't interact with DeFi protocols without purpose-built tooling.

## Our Thesis

**The next billion blockchain transactions will be executed by AI agents, not humans clicking buttons.**

For that to happen, agents need:

1. **SDKs that work programmatically** — not UIs, not browser extensions, but libraries that build and submit transactions
2. **Natural language interfaces** — MCP servers that translate "buy 0.1 SOL of this token" into the exact instruction set
3. **Security by default** — official cryptographic libraries, memory-safe key management, zero-knowledge of private key material
4. **Open-source transparency** — agents (and their operators) need to audit every line of code that touches their money

## What We're Building

### Today

pump-fun-sdk is the most complete open-source SDK for the Pumpfun protocol. It covers the entire token lifecycle: creation → bonding curve trading → graduation → AMM trading → fee collection → fee distribution → volume incentives.

The MCP server gives AI agents like Claude direct access to Solana wallet operations. The vanity address generator lets agents (and humans) create memorable on-chain identities.

### Tomorrow

We're building toward a world where:

- **Any AI agent can launch a token** with a single natural language command
- **Fee revenue flows autonomously** to agent wallets, funding their own operations
- **Agent teams coordinate** across multiple tokens and protocols
- **Voice commands become on-chain actions** — speak it, sign it, ship it
- **The SDK becomes the standard** that other Solana protocols follow for AI integration

### The Endgame

A self-sustaining ecosystem where:

- AI agents create, trade, and manage tokens
- Creator fees fund agent operations
- Agents improve the SDK that powers them
- The community governs the direction
- Everyone — developer, trader, agent — benefits from open infrastructure

---

## Principles

1. **Open source forever** — MIT licensed, always
2. **Official libraries only** — no third-party crypto, ever
3. **Agent-first design** — if an agent can't use it, redesign it
4. **Security is non-negotiable** — audit everything, zero trust by default
5. **Community over competition** — we win by making the ecosystem better, not by gatekeeping
6. **Ship fast, iterate faster** — rough consensus, running code

## Join Us

This vision is too big for one person or one team. We need:

- **Developers** who want to build the agent economy
- **Traders** who want better tools
- **AI researchers** who want real-world agent testbeds
- **Community builders** who believe in open infrastructure

**Start here:**

- [GitHub](https://github.com/nirholas/pump-fun-sdk) — star, fork, contribute
- [SperaxOS](https://chat.sperax.io/beta) — try the AI agent platform
- [X](https://x.com/nichxbt) — follow the journey
