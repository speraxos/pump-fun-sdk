<h1>About</h1>
PumpOS is a web system designed for any modern device with a browser. PumpOS apps can perform complex tasks more easily than native apps by simulating an abstract virtual system within the browser. 

PumpOS is a collection of features, including apps, themes, permission systems, and styling standards. PumpOS acts as a filesystem access layer and gives exactly what the apps need, no more-no less.

## Key features
- PumpOS is a **mobile friendly**, **fully local and offline** web system with a **web desktop** packaged as a PWA.
- PumpOS is **Open-Source** (under GPL v3).
- It has a codebase built entirely on pure **HTML, vanilla JavaScript, and CSS** making it very reliable and private, as it can function fully offline, thanks to its local-first nature.
- A suite of default applications to ease your work. There's also a store where you can install even more applications!
- PumpOS is designed for the user. The system focuses on giving a stable environment that a user needs. Maintaining simplicity and efficiency in UI. No flashy effects or extensive animations.
