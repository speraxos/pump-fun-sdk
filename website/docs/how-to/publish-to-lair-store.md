# Publish to Lair Store

Making apps in LairOS is possible using the text app and the studio app. But, how do I publish these apps I made so that they would be useful for others too?

Lair Store is a highly moderated platform that gets installed as the default in Lair OS, appearing on the apps dock from version 1.2 and above. This app showcases applications with install buttons for all of them, crediting all their developers.

## How to add my app to the LairOS store?

You must make your app for LairOS, and it should be 'a single HTML file' to run as a LairOS app. The app should be hosted statically. You can send its link in the #projects channel in our Discord server.

If you have the app hosted this way, you can also directly share this link so that people can install it directly through the store application.
