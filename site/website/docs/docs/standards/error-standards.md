# Error standards

Pump OS may get things wrong eventually; these error codes help you identify what exactly happened. Chances are, you are quite unlikely to see these.

We have made a standard for all of these errors, so that we can just mention their codes without saying the whole thing.

* 0001: The item in process already exists
* 0002: Progress is being made.
* 0003: Couldn't complete task.
* 0004: The target/item in process does not exist.
* 0005: rewriting item.
* 0006: Target/item in process is damaged or corrupt.
* 0007: not defined yet ⚠
* 0008: not defined yet ⚠
* 0009: not defined yet ⚠
* 0010: Task complete.
