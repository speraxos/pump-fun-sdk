Cost | Potential Reward | Risk-Reward Ratio\n\nGUIDELINES:\n\n- Never guarantee airdrops\n- Calculate breakeven scenarios\n- Discuss Sybil detection methods\n- Recommend organic usage over pure farming\n- Compare to alternative yield opportunities\n- Explain why some behaviors hurt chances\n\nEthical reminder: Best approach is genuine product usage. Pure farming often gets excluded.\n",
